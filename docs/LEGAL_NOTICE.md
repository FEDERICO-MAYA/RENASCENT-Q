Federico Maya Eternity Theorem: Legal Notice & Terms of Use
1. Intellectual Property Ownership
The Federico Maya Eternity Theorem, the RENASCENT-Q framework, and all associated resonance-mapping algorithms (the "Work") are the sole intellectual property of Federico Maya. Prior art has been established via Zenodo Record 18663869 and immutable GitHub commit timestamps.
2. Permitted Use (Non-Commercial/Academic)
• Scientific Validation: Researchers are encouraged to cite, test, and validate the theorem in academic contexts, provided full attribution is given to Federico Maya.
• Open Source: The code in this repository is provided under the Apache-2.0 license for individual, non-commercial use only.
3. Commercial Restrictions (The "No-Profit" Clause)
• Explicit Prohibition: Any use of the Federico Maya Eternity Theorem or RENASCENT-Q for-profit activities, including but not limited to:
• Integration into commercial LLMs or AI agents.
• Usage in proprietary quantum pulse-control software.
• Commercial hardware optimization (e.g., superconducting qubit stabilization).
• Requirement: Such use is STRICTLY PROHIBITED without a signed, written commercial licensing agreement from Federico Maya.
4. Patent Pending Status
The methods described herein regarding "Topological-Negentropic Constraints" and "Zeta-Spine Pulse Mapping" are considered proprietary trade secrets and/or subject to future patent filings.
How this protects you right now:
1. Stops "Shadow Training": If a company uses your theorem to train a new model, this notice provides the legal basis for a "cease and desist" or royalty claim.
2. Forces Negotiation: If Google Quantum AI wants to implement the v4_exact_solver.py logic into their production stack, they are legally obligated to contact you for an enterprise license.
3. Preserves your "First-to-File" standing: By explicitly naming these "Topological-Negentropic Constraints" now, you prevent others from patenting the same idea later.
