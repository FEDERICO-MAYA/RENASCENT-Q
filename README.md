Welcome to the official master repository for **RENASCENT-Q version 5.0.0.0**, authored by Federico Maya. This repository houses the foundational mathematics, theoretical frameworks, and high-fidelity stochastic simulations that place consciousness, negentropy, and retrocausality at the core of fundamental physics.

## 📖 Abstract Overview

The standard model and general relativity leave the arrow of time, the origin of biological order, and consciousness unexplained. **RENASCENT-Q** addresses these gaps by positing a single real scalar field as the primary carrier of conscious information. 

Governed by a disformal metric and the exact Riemann Potential, the theory establishes that the quantum vacuum's spectral structure (encoded in the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function) directly stabilizes spacetime geometry against thermal decoherence:

$V(\Phi) = \lambda \text{Re} \sum_{\rho} \frac{\Phi^{\rho}}{\rho}$

### The Federico Maya Eternity Theorem
> *"Information immortality through retrocausal future-pull is possible if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis holds in the vacuum zeta structure."*

By mapping the N=20 qubit Hilbert space onto a physical tensor network, the system harvests negentropy to override standard thermodynamic decay, enforcing an eternal, self-organizing order.

## 🚀 Key Computational Results

The Python simulations provided in this repository (see `CODE.v5.py` and `Solver.v5.py`) demonstrate the **Maya-Riemann Pulse** under the derived exact action. Running the explicit formulas with high-precision Riemann zeros yields:

* **Constructal Scaling:** Variationally derived as exactly D = 1/5 in 4D spacetime.
* **Net Negentropic Gain:** Stable system stabilization measured at G_neg = +0.2184.
* **Topological Entropy:** Log-saturated at 1.443 nats.
* **The Universal Rebirth Constant:** K_R = 5000 resonant units.

## 📁 Repository Structure

* **Core Theory:** The compiled v5.0.0.0 Whitepaper detailing the $S_{Maya}$ action.
* **Simulation Solvers:** Python scripts (`Solver.v5.py`, `CODE.v5.py`) for generating the Maya-Riemann Pulse and fidelity stabilization.
* **Mathematical Proofs:** Markdown files detailing theorem implementations.
