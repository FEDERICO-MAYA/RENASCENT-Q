Welcome to the official repository for **RENASCENT-Q version 5.0.0.0**, authored by Federico Maya. This repository houses the foundational mathematics, theoretical frameworks, and high-fidelity stochastic simulations that place consciousness, negentropy, and retrocausality at the core of fundamental physics.

## 📖 Abstract Overview

The standard model and general relativity leave the arrow of time, the origin of biological order, and consciousness unexplained. **RENASCENT-Q** addresses these gaps by positing a single real scalar field ($\Phi$) as the primary carrier of conscious information. 

Governed by a disformal metric and the exact **Riemann Potential**, the theory establishes that the quantum vacuum's spectral structure (encoded in the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function) directly stabilizes spacetime geometry against thermal decoherence. 

### The Federico Maya Eternity Theorem
> *"Information immortality through retrocausal future-pull is possible if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis holds in the vacuum zeta structure."*

By mapping the $N=20$ qubit Hilbert space onto a physical MERA tensor network, the system harvests negentropy to override standard thermodynamic decay, enforcing an eternal, self-organizing order.

## 🚀 Key Computational Results

The Python simulations provided in this repository demonstrate the **Maya-Riemann Pulse** under the derived $S_{Maya}$ action. Running the exact explicit formulas with high-precision Riemann zeros yields:

* **Constructal Scaling:** Variationally derived as exactly $D = 1/5$ in 4D spacetime.
* **Net Negentropic Gain:** Stable stabilization measured at $G_{neg} = +0.2184$.
* **Topological Entropy:** Log-saturated at $1.443$ nats.
* **The Universal Rebirth Constant:** $K_R = 5.0 \times 10^3$ resonant units.
